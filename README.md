# Feature Extraction from RS-HR Data Using AI/ML with Seamless Mosaic Visualization Using Radiometric Normalization

## Project Description

This project, focused  on the problem statement 14 of Bhuvan's Space Hackathon, focuses on the innovative extraction of features from various satellite imagery, ranging from low to high resolution. The primary goal is to extract both point and linear features from satellite imagery covering the entire Indian landmass. These images, acquired over time spans ranging from a month to several years, present a unique challenge for radiometric normalization to create a seamless mosaic.

### Objectives

1. **Point Features Extraction**: Identify and extract features such as  Ponds, Check Dams, Dug Wells, Windmills, Electric Substations, Stadiums , Airport , Solar Panel 

2. **Linear Features Extraction**: Extract linear features like River Footprints from LISS-IV/LISS-III/AWiFS imagery.

3. **Radiometric Normalization**: Apply radiometric normalization techniques on satellite imagery to enhance feature visualization on the base layer.

### Expected Outcomes

1. **Dataset Generation**: Create a class-wise labeled dataset with different features as separate classes.

2. **Multi-label Classification Model**: Develop a multi-label classification model with robust generalization capabilities.

3. **Improved Radiometric Normalization**: Establish a more effective method of radiometric normalization for mosaic creation, leading to enhanced visualization.
